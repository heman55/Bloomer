	<h1>I Need Rest</h1>
	<h2>Neha Sah</h2>
	<h3>English Department,
	<br />Surya Sen Mahavidyalaya</h3>
	<p>I need rest...
	<br />Rest from the world
	<br />Rest from the stress
	<br />Stress of everyday's life pressures.</p>
	<p>Here she says this,
	<br />There he says that,
	<br />People are there
	<br />But no one is here
	<br />To listen problems.
	<br />It is not that corona has affected upon me 
	<br />But loneliness has killed me...
	<br />Since four months.
	<br />It is not that before there was no problems
	<br />But that problems were automatically solved by
	<br />Watching the outside areas...
	<br />Area of thousands of faces,
	<br />Area where you could find reason for being happy,
	<br />Area where you loved by strangers for no reasons
	<br />Area where you could talk with nature.
	<br />But now their is nothing left
	<br />Except mobile phone
	<br />Where people don't ask how you are
	<br />Just show their status through Whatsapp
	<br />Not permanently, will be change in few seconds.
	<br />All are busy, I too busy
	<br />Busy in my life 
	<br />But my life is over there
	<br />Behind the shelf.
	<br />So...I need rest 
	<br />Rest from the world
	<br />Rest from the stress
	<br />Stress of everyday's life pressures.
