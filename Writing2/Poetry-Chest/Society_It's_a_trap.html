<h1>Society: It's a Trap</h1>
<h2><i>Biswajit Roy</i></h2>
<p><i>Humans live in a society
<br />Do they live amicably?
<br />Religion must be a good reason to live happily
<br />They must have morality.</p>
<p>Where relatives, neighbours are not nasty
<br />They do render good advice invariably!
<br />They be proud of your success overwhelmingly
<br />Society will not judge you on your poverty.</p>
<p>Society will give you parable
<br />Just like Jesus Christ
<br />It will take you into its lap
<br />Now think in reverse what says this fable
<br />Don't look down, you're an equilibrist
<br />Society, it's a trap.</i></p>
