<h1>Irreverence and Disdain Towards Women: Jayanta Mahapartra's Poetic Vision</h1>
<h2>by Smt. Hema Hansda and Smt. Joyeeta Paul Chowdhury</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The present text is a review and re-analysis of the portrayl of womens' condition in India through the eyes of the famous poet Jayanta Mahapatra.
<br />He was highly concerned about the pain and struggles of the women of his contemporary society. He draws keen insight of the silent women who are left unknowm
<br />and uncared and being treated as a toy in the hands of men. His voice against such patriarchy makes his poems impeccable and idiosyncratic.
<p><b>Intoduction</b></p>
<p>"Vande Mataram"- which means "I bow to you mother" has always been the greatest slogan of Indians towards their motherland. In India women have always
<br />been treated like goddesses and embodiment of love. But that is only for religious and cultural purposes. In reality or in everyday life women 
<br />have been suffering from physical and mental torture given by the same Indians. Though society pretends to respect women; history is full of 
<br />instances where women are meted out injustice and denied from basic necessities. From pre to post-independence many writers have thrown light 
<br />into this matter of great concern. One such notable post-independence poet is Jayanta Mahapatra who was deeply motified at the sufferings of 
<br /> Indian women. His poems have expressed the agitating conditions and sufferings of women in the patriarchal society of India.</p>
<p>It is an attempt to take a review and development of Indian poems in Englush. How the poet applied the modern views, which uses the new styles 
<br />and applies them to their creations. The poem entitled "Hunger" and "The Whorehouse in the Calcutta Street" are two types of his excellent 
<br />creation on this theme.
<p><b>Analysis the status of women in the poems of Mahapatra</b></p>
<p>"Hunger" is one of the most renowed poems of Jayanta Mahapatra. It is categorised by great concision of expression. The poem expresses Mahapatra's 
<br />concern over poverty and the discrimination of women which are the two major problems in India. In "Hunger" the fisherman makes an argument to
<br />offer his daughter as a medium of sexual satisfaction. This very scene represents the modern poor life; it expresses the sense of craving of 
<br />an empty stomach. The poem shows the struggle of poor and the conflict of body versus mind. Financial Independence compels the father to push
<br />his young daughter towards prostitution.</p>
<p><b>"she opened her wormy legs wide"</b></p>
<p>the line expresses that the girl has been unfamiliar with starve the love of her father. Mahapatra expresses his spiritual fight against the 
<br />parent because the society was not enemy of that skiny young girl. Though the girl doesn't speak much infront of her father but she achieves
<br />her eloquence through silence. Another poem of Mahapatra entitled "The Whorehouse in the Calcutta Street" tries to transcend the pseudo-
<br />hierarchical attitude of the patriarchy in the society. The position of woman through his poetic eyes was far more elevated than it was in reality.</p>
<p><b>"Dream children, dark, superflous;
<br />you miss them in the house's dark, how can't you?
<br />Even the woman don't wear them-
<br />like jewels or precious stones at the throat;
<br />the faint feeling deep at a woman's centre
<br />that brings back the discarded things:
<br />the little turnings of blood 
<br />at the far edge of the rainbow."</b></p>
<p>A woman who can give her body in exchange of money has never been considered as a normal human being; as a part of civic society. Intellectuals think 
<br />that its a blasphemy. Mahapatra gave a trancended romantic identity to those women. His poem "The Whorehouse in the Calcutta Street" seems to deal 
<br /> with the struggle and again that the prostitute suffer everyday while confronting the "cultured society". Now an important question pop-up in 
<br />our head; what exactly does one mean by "Cultured"? Does it mean to be civilized, well-educated, having a great sense about the socio-political 
<br />reality? or, it does signify an inevitability of the human metabolism?</p>
<p><b>"perhaps their reminding themselves
<br />Of looked-after children and of home:
<br />the shooting stars in the eager darkness of return."</b></p>
<p>If we consider the word "children" as "prostitute's family" and the word "home" as "a place belongs to the society"; it means they have to step out
<br />from their home to earn livelihood by the contenment of the darknesss and after this they departs from their family,who all become the part of society,
<br />is formed as they deals with the hurt by their soul in term of the public. So, now we can see the comparison between the two poems through perspective 
<br />of poverty and exploitation. An young girl in the poem "Hunger" and a prostitute in "The Whorehouse in the Calcutta Street" both are suffering from 
<br />the same pain and struggle in term of poverty, lack of financial independence.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p> To conclude, we can see that Jayanta Mahapatra's poems approaches the harsh reality of the contemporary post independence Indian society. It was true
<br /> that India is politically inpendent but the people of India was not truly independent neither financially nor in their minds. Poverty choked them.
<br />As in "Hunger" we see poverty breaks down the common relation between the father and his daughter. Poet is not ready to accept this cruel reality.
<br />Selling his daughter in exchange of money is not supportable by Mahapatra. Also in the Poem "The Whorehouse in the Calcutta Street"poet shows how
<br />lack of financial independency makes women to sell them as a medium of sexual satisfaction. In "Hunger" the young girl was also the victim of same 
<br />situation</p>
<p>Jayanta Mahapatra's raises his dissident voice against the women discrimination in Indian Post-Independence society not in a clear manner but in a 
<br />hidden way through his excellent poetic skills.</p>
