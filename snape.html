		<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
		<p>There is sometimes a very fine line between 'good' and 'evil' and Snape is the prime example of that being mean and unfair as well as a great 
		<br />aid in defeating Lord Voldemort. He appears to be moving along the good-evil axis within the story, and it is only after finishing the whole
		<br />series that the readers can fully try to understand the complex psychological motivation for his actions. Because of Snape's complexity, 
		<br />readers are forced to go back and take another, closer, look at his characters.</p>
		<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
		<p>"Always"- This one word gained Severus Snape millions of fans worldwide. Snape's life had been an intense rollercoaster and the trials he had
		<br />faced were almot at par with those that Harry Potter had persevered through. For almost seven books and more than 3,000 pages, Snape had been
		<br />a character readers loved to hate. Professor Severus Snape, who had seemed throughly evil all through the series, but with a radical shift in
		<br />his character stood for one of the biggest plot twist in all seven books. Not only did he turn out to be a hero- he had also, all his life, 
		<br />felt a deep love for Harry's mother Lily and had risked his life on a daily basis for her- and ultimately for Harry as well. According to
		<br />Harry, Professor Snape is "probably the bravest man ever knew".
		<p>While trying to understand Snape's complicated reasons, we have to start by looking at his childhood which is described for the first time in 
		<br />the very last book "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows". There are events and circumstances in Snape's childhood that can give some 
		<br />explanation to his actions and provide us with a deeper understanding of his motives. There was not such detailed description of Snape's
		<br />childhood, but a few words show for a quite difficult up-bringing.</p>
		<p>Snape's years at Hogwarts are difficult to say and it is the period of time in which Snape turns into the puzzling person. In the fifth book, 
		<br />"Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix", we get first glimpse of Snape's school years. While elevan-year-old Snape is sorted into the house
		<br />of Slytherin, Lily is sorted into the house of Gryffindor, a natural rival to Slytherin. In addition to this Harry's father, James Potter,and
		<br />his friend Sirius Black are both into Gryffindor and they treat Snape badly since very first meeting on the Hogwarts Express.</p>
		<p>Young Snape has the capacity to be kind, trying to console Lily, but easily triggered by James comments. James and Sirius loathe Snape and 
		<br />humiliate him when they get chance, preferably in front of Lily. It is only natural to hate the people who treat you in that manner for 
		<br />that many years; Snape's reaction is only human. His suffering gives the reader an emotional investment in his development. What makes 
		<br />for some confusion while reading the book is how Snape transfers his hatred for James onto Harry while the reader is left in the dark as
		<br />to why that is.</p>
		<p>In the last book, while reading Snape's memories, we discover that Lily and Snape's friendship is lost because Lily doesn't like the people
		<br />Snape surrounds himself with and because he had called her a 'mudblood', a derogatory term for someone who is muggle-born, in a fit of rage
		<br />caused by James and Sirius. Not only does he lose his best friend and love of his life, the fact that Lily later goes on and marry James Potter,
		<br />his worst enemy, must have been difficult to take. Snape sees Harry, a spitting image of James, except for the green eyes he got from Lily which
		<br />are always reminding him of his lost love and decides to torment him in any way possible.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, adult Snape is more complex than his young version, he is constantly moving between making life difficult for Harry and lending a helping 
		<br />hand in various ways. In the very first book,"Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone"(1997), during Quidditch game, as Harry is riding his broom,
		<br />someone put a shell on it tries to throw him off. Ron and Hermione see Snape in the audience with fixed eyes on Harry and muttering words under his 
		<br />breath. They assume it is Snape who put a spell on Harry's broom but later it is revealed that it is Professor Quirell who tried to kill Harry and
		<br />Snape actually prevents Harry from falling to his death by cancelling out Professor Quirell's curse with his own counter-curse.</p>
		<p>In the fifth book, "The Order of the Phoenix", Harry has a fake vision, planted by Voldemort himself, of how Voldemort is torturing his Godfather 
		<br />Sirius Black. To make sure it is not a trap, Harry and his friends try to contact Sirius through the fireplace in the Professor Dolores Umbridge's
		<br />Office but are caught in the office. Snape alerts the Order to save Sirius. He could easily ignored the message and let the Death Eaters kill Harry 
		<br />and his friends. But he does not;he makes sure that help is on the way, though he does not take part in the rescue mission himself. From the readers 
		<br />perspective,it is expected that Snape would pretend to not understand and not to care so when it is revealed that it is because of him that help was 
		<br />providedit reverses the reader's mind.</p>
		<p>Not only does Professor Snape save Harry's life on more than one ocassion, he is also a great assistance in defeating Lord Voldemort often risking his own 
		<br />life. In the "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", Professor Quirell is on a mission for Voldemort, trying to steal the Philosopher's Stone in order
		<br />to make the Elixir of Life and thus helping Voldemort coming back to life just inhabiting someone else's body. Quirell sets a loose troll in the castle and
		<br />during the chaos, that follows, he tries to go through the trap door but Snape rushes to stop him, he is wounded in the leg by the three-headed dog gaurding
		<br />the trap door. From the fact that the readers know that Snape is wounded, it seems as if he was one to steal the stone</p>
		<p>In Adiition to this, in the last book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", Harry and his friends are looking for horcruxes, pieces of Voldemort's soul
		<br />trapped inside on an object, which are extremely difficult to destroy. One way is to use the sword of Gryffindor. Dumbledore made a replica of the sword and
		<br />gave the real sword to Snape before he died. There is a well-kept secret all through the last book and it is only after Snape's death that the readers, and
		<br />Harry and his friends, realize what Dumbledore planned and how Snape executed the plan in order to give the sword to Harry. </p>
		<p>Harry cannot understand Snape's motives, it is kept secret until the very last book. Because of the fact that the reader sees everything mainly through Harry,
		<br />there is a tendency to dismiss all evidence of how Snape might be a good character.</p>
		
		<p>Snape had made big sacrifices in his life in order to defeat Voldemort but most of them are revealed in the last book when Harry looks at Snape's memories.
		<br />As when Dumbledore finds one horcrux and destroy it, he is fatally cursed. He is slowly dying. His last request is to have Snapr kill him. Apart from the 
		<br />emotional impact of killing Dumbledore it would also mean that he would be misunderstood and perceived as a traitor by everyone. by killing Dumbledore, Snape
		<br />manages to play the part of ally to his enemies and an enemy to his friend.</p>
	    <p>One can easily state that Snape has its difficult from the start and in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" Dumbledore says,"You know, I sometime think we 
		<br />sort too soon..." reffering to how Snape was sorted into the House of Slytherin. A true Gryffindor student has bravery as the most essential trait, and 
		<br />according to Dumbledore this is where Snape indeed belong.</p>
        <p>To conclude, one might have guessed, the answer to that will never ever be that simple. Surely, we all have our own opinions on Snape's action, but really, the 
        <br />the true answer is that no one is truly good or bad in the end: just made up of many different shades.
		<br />So, to quote Sirius Black from "Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix":
		<br /><b>"We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are"</b>.</p>
