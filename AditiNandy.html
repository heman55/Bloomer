<p><b>Analysis:</b></p>
<p>William Shakespeare's <it>'Othello'</it> is a play loaded with controversy and manipulation and most of the time we generated by 
<br />the play: <b> Main Manipulator Iago</b>. The story revolves around four central characters. Othello, Desdemona,his beloved wife, Cassio and Iago.
<br />In <it>Othello</it>, it is Iago who manupulates all other personalities by controlling their movements and trapping them in an intricate net of lies.
<br />He achieves this by getting close to all personalities and playing on their weaknesses while they refer to him as honest Iago, thus furthering his 
<br />control over the characters.</p>
<p>Iago's use of reverse psychology captivates other's attention and serve as a tool to ensure that he himself appears honest and unwilling to implicate
<br />others. On the surface, he seems to have a loyal and worthy friend but his wording and tone always imply the opposite of what he says. When Othello
<br />asks whether it was Cassio that talked with his wife, Iago appears be an honest friend who wants to see the best in others. However, in saying this,
<br />Iago leads to Othello to do the exact reverse while expressing his apparent hope that rumour is untrue. On numerous other occasion, Iago urges Othello 
<br />to be patient and calm, but these comments only feed Othello's rage and his belief that the rumuors are true, which is precisey what Iago desires.</p>
<p>Iago is a character who has a role play but at the same time he is also a director who directs the actions of the characters and decides on the 
<br />development of the plot of the play. He serves his master, yet he also controls his master. He plans his actions and ensures the outcome. Yet he does
<br />not have any visible motives. The duality that he constantly shows throughout the play, confirms the complexities of Iago's personality that he is not
<br />only a man seeking vengeance.</p>
<p>Trust is a powerful thing that Iagoeasily abuses. Iago is a master of abusing people's trust to gain more power and further the completion of his goals.
<br />Iago poisons peoples thought by creating ideasin their heads without implicating himself.</p>
<p>Iago compares himself to a <b>'Devil'</b>. He is aware of his own evil and dismissing the natural state of morality but he chooses to be evil anyway.
<br />Furthermore, in his scheming he takes sadistic pleasure; there are no good qualities in his nature.</p>
<p>When we work hard to achieve our goals, it can be difficult to watch others who are less accomplished than we are, achieve what we've wanted, 
<br />without as much work. This type of situation can cause us to feel envious and jealous of the other person. Some people might use this type of situation
<br />to challenge themselves to reach their goal, while others might decide to destroy the person they believe stands in their way.</p>
<p>In Shakespeare's play <it>'Othello'</it>, Iago is a soldier with hopes of being promoted to liuetenant. He becomes angry and vengeful when he is passed over 
<br />for promotion. A less experienced soldier, Cassio, is promoted to liuetenant instead of Iago. This action triggers anger in Iago,and he talks out his 
<br />anger on his master, Othello. Iago desires to destroy Othello's life and marriage even if others are harmed in the process. Iago explains that he wants
<br />to destroy Othello because he has been passed over promotion to liuetenant; however he offers other motives for his hatred of Othello throughout the
<br />course of the play. He mentions he believes Othello is having an affair with his wife, Emilia. He states, <b>"it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets,
<br />he has done my office"(Act-I Scene-III, lines 369-370)</b>. He also mentions having a desire for Desdemona because he wants to seek revenge on Othello,
<br /><b>"wife for wife"(Act-II, Scene-II, lines289)</b>. Eventually, it becomes clear that Iago has no real motives for hurting Othello and his character
<br />appears to be avice figure, a stock character who personifies immoral behaviour by tempting others. </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>From the above discussion, we can see that Iago is a person who was able to takeover Othello with his psychological manipulation. All he mainly wanted to do 
<br />was to have back Othello for taking the promotion that he wanted. He worked his way into Othello's head and made him become a green-eyed monster. He is the 
<br />symbolic representation of what the devil stands for, destructiveness and of nothigness. The way he creates evil the destruction of the people around him
<br />is an artist who makes his masterpiece. In conclusion, Iago creates destruction and his materials are the people around him, like an artist who makes his
<br />work from the materials around him.</p>
